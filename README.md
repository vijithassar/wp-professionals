# wp-professionals

This is a WordPress plugin which turns posts into professional listings, wrapping the content with Twitter links as well as categories for topical specialties and hierarchical locations. It just reads custom post meta fields and applies them through a filter. You can see it in action at [Writers of Color](http://www.writersofcolor.org).
